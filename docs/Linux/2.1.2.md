# 2.1.2 Terminal vs Console vs SSH

The terms *terminal*, *console*, and *SSH* are often used interchangeably, but they describe different concepts.

Understanding the differences helps clarify how and where commands are executed.

---

## Terminal

A **terminal** is a software application that allows users to interact with the shell.

Key characteristics:
- Runs inside a graphical environment
- Provides a window for command-line input
- Common on desktop systems

Most users interact with Linux through a terminal emulator.

---

## Console

The **console** refers to a direct system interface, traditionally connected to the machine itself.

Historically:
- It was a physical screen and keyboard
- Used for system administration and recovery

Today, the console concept still exists, especially during system startup or low-level troubleshooting.

---

## SSH

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a protocol for accessing a remote system securely over a network.

SSH allows users to:
- Log into remote Linux systems
- Execute commands remotely
- Manage servers without physical access

SSH is commonly used in server and cloud environments.

---

## Local vs Remote Interaction

- Terminal and console access are typically local
- SSH access is remote
- The commands and shell behavior remain largely the same

> The difference lies in *how* you connect, not *what* you can do once connected.
