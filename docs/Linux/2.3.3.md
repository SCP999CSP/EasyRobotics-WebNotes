# 2.3.3 Redirection and Pipes

Linux commands often produce text output.  
Redirection and pipes allow you to control **where this output goes and how it is used**.

---

## Output Redirection

Command output can be:
- Written to a file
- Overwritten or appended

This is useful for saving results, logs, or reports.

---

## Input Redirection

Commands can also receive input from files instead of the keyboard.

Input redirection enables:
- Automated processing
- Consistent input handling
- Script-friendly workflows

---

## Pipes: Connecting Commands

Pipes allow the output of one command to become the input of another.

This enables:
- Step-by-step data processing
- Building powerful command chains
- Combining simple tools into complex workflows

---

## Why This Matters

Redirection and pipes are core ideas in Unix-like systems.

They allow:
- Flexibility
- Reusability
- Efficient text processing

> 📌 Key Idea:  
> Small tools become powerful when connected together.
