# 2.4.1 vim Modes Overview

vim operates using different modes, each designed for a specific type of interaction.

Understanding these modes is the key to using vim effectively.

## Normal Mode

Normal mode is the default mode when vim starts.

It is used for:
- Navigating the file
- Deleting or copying text
- Executing commands

Most vim actions begin in normal mode.

---

## Insert Mode

Insert mode allows you to:
- Enter and modify text
- Type freely like in a traditional editor

This mode is entered from normal mode and exited when editing is complete.

---

## Command Mode

Command mode is used to:
- Save files
- Exit vim
- Perform advanced commands

Commands are entered at the bottom of the screen and affect the entire file or editor state.

## Mode Switching

Efficient vim usage depends on switching modes deliberately and correctly.
