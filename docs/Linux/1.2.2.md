# 1.2.2 Desktop vs Server Editions

Linux distributions are often available in both desktop and server editions.  
The difference lies not in the kernel, but in how the system is configured and used.

## Desktop Editions

Desktop editions are designed for:
- Personal computers
- Graphical user interfaces (GUI)
- Daily interactive use

They typically include:
- A desktop environment
- Preinstalled applications
- User-friendly configuration tools

Desktop editions are suitable for learning Linux and general-purpose computing.

## Server Editions

Server editions are optimized for:
- Running services continuously
- Remote access and administration
- Minimal resource usage

They usually:
- Do not include a graphical interface by default
- Emphasize command-line usage
- Focus on stability and security

Server editions are commonly used in production environments.

## Key Differences in Practice

The main differences between desktop and server editions involve:
- Default software selection
- Resource usage
- User interaction model

The underlying Linux system remains the same.
