# 1.3.2 Introduction to the Linux Directory Structure

Linux organizes files using a single hierarchical directory structure, starting from the root directory `/`.

Unlike some operating systems, Linux does not separate files by physical drives.  
Everything is part of one unified directory tree.

---

## Root Directory `/`

The root directory is the top level of the Linux file system.

All other directories and files exist under `/`.

---

## `/home`

The `/home` directory contains personal directories for users.

It is typically used for:
- User files
- Personal configurations
- Project data

Each user usually has a dedicated subdirectory under `/home`.

---

## `/etc`

The `/etc` directory stores system-wide configuration files.

It commonly includes:
- System settings
- Service configuration files
- Startup-related configurations

Files in `/etc` are usually text-based and edited by administrators.

---

## `/bin`

The `/bin` directory contains essential command binaries.

These programs are required for:
- Basic system operation
- Single-user or recovery modes

Many fundamental system commands are located here.

---

## `/usr`

The `/usr` directory contains user-level programs and libraries.

It typically includes:
- Applications
- Shared libraries
- Documentation

Most installed software resides under `/usr`.

## Why This Structure Matters

Understanding the directory structure helps you:
- Know where files are located
- Avoid modifying critical system components unintentionally
- Navigate the system with confidence

> You do not need to memorize every directory now.  
> Familiarity will come naturally through daily usage.
