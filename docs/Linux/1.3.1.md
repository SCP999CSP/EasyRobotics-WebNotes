# 1.3.1 Kernel / Shell / User Space

A Linux system is commonly described using three core components:  
the **kernel**, the **shell**, and **user space**.

Each component has a distinct responsibility.

---

## Kernel

The kernel is the core of the Linux system.

It is responsible for:
- Managing hardware resources
- Scheduling CPU processes
- Handling memory
- Controlling devices

The kernel runs continuously and operates at the lowest level of the system.

---

## User Space

User space refers to all programs that run outside the kernel.

This includes:
- System utilities
- Background services
- User applications

User space programs cannot access hardware directly.  
They must request services from the kernel.

---

## Shell

The shell is a special type of user space program.

Its role is to:
- Interpret user commands
- Pass requests to the kernel
- Display output to the user

The shell acts as a bridge between the user and the operating system.

---

## How They Work Together

In practice:
- The user interacts with the shell
- The shell communicates with the kernel
- The kernel manages hardware and system resources

---

> 📌 Summary:  
> The kernel controls the system, user space runs programs, and the shell connects users to the system.
