# 2.4.3 Cursor Movement and Deletion

vim uses keyboard-based navigation instead of a mouse.

Learning basic movement and deletion commands makes editing faster and more precise.

---

## Cursor Movement

vim allows cursor movement:
- Character by character
- Line by line
- Without leaving the keyboard

This design supports efficient text editing.

---

## Deleting Text

Deletion operations can target:
- Single characters
- Entire lines
- Blocks of text

Understanding deletion scope helps avoid unintended changes.

---

## Copying and Pasting

vim supports copying and pasting text internally.

These actions are commonly used for reorganizing file content.

---

## Undoing Changes

Mistakes are expected during editing.

vim provides undo functionality to safely revert changes.
