# 2.2.2 File Operations

Files are the core of everyday work in Linux.  
This section introduces the basic concepts behind creating, copying, moving, and deleting files.

## Creating Files

Files can be created as placeholders or as part of configuration and scripting workflows.  
Even empty files play an important role in many systems.

---

## Copying Files and Directories

Copying allows you to:
- Duplicate files
- Create backups
- Reuse directory structures

Understanding the difference between copying files and directories is important for correct results.

## Moving and Renaming Files

Moving files can also be used to rename them.  
This operation is commonly used to reorganize projects or adjust file names.

---

## Deleting Files and Directories

File deletion is a powerful operation.

Important considerations:
- Deleted files usually cannot be easily recovered
- Removing directories may affect many files at once
- Caution is especially important when working as an administrator
