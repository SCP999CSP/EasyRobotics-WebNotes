# 2.1.1 What Is a Shell (bash)

A **shell** is a program that provides an interface between the user and the operating system.

In Linux, the shell interprets user input and translates it into instructions that the system can execute.

## Role of the Shell

The shell is responsible for:
- Reading commands entered by the user
- Interpreting those commands
- Passing requests to the operating system
- Displaying output and results

The shell does not execute hardware operations directly.  
Instead, it communicates with the operating system on behalf of the user.

## bash and Its Role in Linux

**bash** (Bourne Again SHell) is the most commonly used shell in Linux systems.

It is popular because:
- It is powerful and flexible
- It supports scripting and automation
- It is widely available by default

Many Linux tutorials and scripts assume bash as the default shell.

## Shell and the Operating System

The shell sits between:
- The user
- The operating system (via the kernel)

In practice:
- The user interacts with the shell
- The shell communicates with the operating system
- The operating system manages hardware and system resources

> The shell is your primary communication channel with the Linux system.
