# 1.2 Linux Distributions Overview

A Linux distribution (often called a “distro”) is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel, combined with system tools, libraries, package managers, and user applications.

Although all Linux distributions share the same kernel, they differ in:
- Package management systems
- Default software selections
- Release cycles
- Target users and use cases

## Why Distributions Exist

Linux distributions exist to address different needs, such as:
- Server stability
- Desktop usability
- Enterprise support
- Embedded or lightweight systems

Each distribution makes design choices that balance stability, features, and ease of use.

## Common Distribution Families

Most Linux distributions belong to a few major families, including:
- Debian-based distributions
- Red Hat–based distributions
- Independent or specialized distributions

Understanding these families helps you transfer skills between systems, even if the exact commands or tools differ slightly.
