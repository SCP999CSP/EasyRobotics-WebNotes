# 2.2.1 Directory Operations

Directories organize files into a structured hierarchy.  
Understanding how to navigate and manage directories is essential for working efficiently in Linux.

---

## Viewing the Current Working Directory

At any moment, the system keeps track of a **current working directory**.  
Many commands operate relative to this location.

Knowing where you are in the file system helps prevent mistakes.

---

## Listing Directory Contents

Directories can be displayed in different formats to show:
- File names
- Permissions and ownership
- Hidden files

Different listing styles provide different levels of detail, depending on your needs.

---

## Navigating with Relative and Absolute Paths

Linux allows navigation using:
- **Absolute paths**, which start from the root directory
- **Relative paths**, which start from the current directory

Understanding the difference makes navigation faster and more predictable.

---

## Creating and Removing Directories

Directories can be created to organize files logically.  
Empty directories can be removed safely, helping keep the file system clean.

> 📌 Tip:  
> Always be aware of your current directory before performing directory operations.
