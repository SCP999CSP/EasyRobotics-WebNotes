# 1.1.1 Operating System vs Kernel

To understand Linux correctly, it is important to distinguish between an **operating system** and a **kernel**.

Although the terms are often used interchangeably, they are not the same.

## What Is an Operating System?

An **operating system (OS)** is the complete environment that allows users and applications to interact with hardware.

An operating system typically includes:
- A kernel
- System utilities and tools
- Libraries
- User interfaces (command-line or graphical)

Examples of operating systems include Linux-based systems, Windows, and macOS.

## What Is a Kernel?

The **kernel** is the core component of an operating system.

Its main responsibilities include:
- Managing CPU processes
- Handling memory allocation
- Controlling hardware devices
- Providing a bridge between software and hardware

The kernel runs at the lowest level and is always active while the system is running.

## How Linux Fits In

Technically speaking:
- **Linux is a kernel**
- A “Linux operating system” is built by combining:
  - The Linux kernel
  - System tools
  - Libraries
  - User applications

This distinction explains why there are many different Linux distributions, all sharing the same kernel but offering different user experiences.
