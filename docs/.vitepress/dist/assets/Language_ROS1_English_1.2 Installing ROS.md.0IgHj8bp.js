Although most general users typically use Windows as their primary operating system, previous versions of ROS had limited support for Windows. Therefore, we have chosen Ubuntu as our operating system to facilitate compatibility with historical versions. There are two common methods for installing Ubuntu:</p><ul><li>Installing Ubuntu on physical hardware (the most common approach is dual-booting with Windows and Ubuntu coexisting);</li><li>Installing Ubuntu on a virtual machine.</li></ul><p>Both approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages:</p><ul><li>Option 1 ensures optimal performance and avoids hardware compatibility issues, but makes interaction with the Windows system less convenient;</li><li>Option 2 facilitates seamless interaction between Windows and Ubuntu, though performance is slightly inferior and hardware interaction may be limited.</li></ul><p>In ROS, some simulation operations are quite resource-intensive and often require interaction with various hardware components (LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, STM32, Arduino, etc.). Therefore, Option 1 is recommended in principle. However, for learning purposes only, Option 2 is generally sufficient. Moreover, Option 2 offers greater convenience for Windows-Ubuntu interaction, making it more user-friendly for learners. Thus, this tutorial will use Option 2. Of course, the specific implementation approach should be chosen according to your needs.</p><p>If you choose to install Ubuntu on a virtual machine and then install ROS, the general workflow is as follows:</p><ol><li>Install virtualization software (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware);</li><li>Create a virtual machine using the virtualization software;</li><li>Install Ubuntu 20.04 on the virtual machine;</li><li>Install ROS on Ubuntu;</li><li>Test whether the ROS environment can run properly.</li></ol><p>For our learning purposes, both VirtualBox and VMware can meet the requirements. Comparing the two, the former is free while the latter is paid, so this tutorial will use VirtualBox.</p>',9)])])}const m=i(o,[["render",r]]);export{d as __pageData,m as default};
