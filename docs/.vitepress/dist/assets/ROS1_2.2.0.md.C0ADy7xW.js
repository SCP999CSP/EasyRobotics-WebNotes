Service communication is based on the <strong>request-response</strong> model, which is a reply mechanism. That is: Node A sends a request to Node B, Node B receives and processes the request, then generates a response result and returns it to Node A. For example, consider the following scenario:</p><blockquote><p>During a robot&#39;s patrol, the control system analyzes sensor data and detects a suspicious object or person... At this point, it needs to take a photo and save it.</p></blockquote><p>In the scenario described above, service communication is used.</p><ul><li>One node needs to send a photo capture request to the camera node. The camera node processes the request and returns the processing result.</li></ul><p>Similar to the application above, service communication is more suitable for application scenarios that require timeliness and involve certain logical processing.</p><hr><h4 id="concept" tabindex="-1"><strong>Concept</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#concept" aria-label="Permalink to “Concept”">​</a></h4><p>A communication pattern that enables data interaction between different nodes through a request-response approach.</p><h4 id="purpose" tabindex="-1"><strong>Purpose</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#purpose" aria-label="Permalink to “Purpose”">​</a></h4><p>Used for occasional, time-sensitive data transmission scenarios that require some logical processing.</p><h4 id="example" tabindex="-1">Example <a class="header-anchor" href="#example" aria-label="Permalink to “Example”">​</a></h4><p>Implement the summation of two numbers.
