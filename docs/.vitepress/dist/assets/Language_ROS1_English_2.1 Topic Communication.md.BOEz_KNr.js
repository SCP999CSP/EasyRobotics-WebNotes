It is based on the <strong>publish-subscribe</strong> model, meaning: one node publishes messages, and another node subscribes to those messages. The application scenarios for topic communication are extremely widespread, such as the following common scenario:</p><blockquote><p>A robot is performing navigation tasks using a LiDAR sensor. The robot collects information perceived by the LiDAR, performs calculations, and then generates motion control information to drive the robot&#39;s chassis movement.</p></blockquote><p>In the scenario described above, topic communication is used multiple times.</p><ul><li>Taking the collection and processing of LiDAR information as an example, in ROS, one node needs to continuously publish the data currently acquired by the LiDAR, while a node within the navigation module subscribes to and parses this LiDAR data.</li><li>Similarly, for the publication of motion messages, the navigation module calculates motion control information in real-time based on the sensor data and publishes it to the chassis. The chassis can have a node that subscribes to this motion information and ultimately converts it into pulse signals to control the motors.</li></ul><p>By extension, the data acquisition from sensors like LiDAR, cameras, GPS, etc., also typically uses topic communication. In other words, topic communication is suitable for application scenarios involving continuously updated data transmission.</p><hr><h4 id="concept" tabindex="-1"><strong>Concept</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#concept" aria-label="Permalink to “Concept”">​</a></h4><p>A communication pattern that enables data interaction between different nodes through a publish-subscribe approach.</p><h4 id="purpose" tabindex="-1"><strong>Purpose</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#purpose" aria-label="Permalink to “Purpose”">​</a></h4><p>Used for data transmission scenarios involving continuously updated information with minimal logical processing.</p><h4 id="examples" tabindex="-1"><strong>Examples</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#examples" aria-label="Permalink to “Examples”">​</a></h4><ol><li>Implement the most basic publish-subscribe model: The publisher sends a text message at a fixed frequency, and the subscriber receives the text and prints it.
