# 3.2.1 Tuple Definition and Immutability

A tuple is defined using **parentheses**, with elements separated by commas.  
Once a tuple is created, its contents **cannot be changed**.

---

## Defining a Tuple

Tuples can contain:
- Numbers
- Strings
- Other data types
- Mixed values

The order of elements is preserved.

---

## Immutability

Immutability means:
- Elements cannot be added, removed, or modified
- The tuple structure remains constant
- Data integrity is preserved

This makes tuples suitable for fixed data collections.
