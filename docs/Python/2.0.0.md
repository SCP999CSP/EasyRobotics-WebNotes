# Chapter 2: Control Flow

Control flow determines **how a program makes decisions and executes code** based on conditions.  
Instead of running instructions line by line without choice, control flow allows programs to react to different situations.

This chapter introduces logical operations, condition evaluation, and the foundation of decision-making in Python.
