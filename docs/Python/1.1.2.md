# 1.1.2 Basic Operators (+ - * / // % **)

Operators are symbols that tell Python how to perform calculations.  
Python provides a set of **basic arithmetic operators** for working with numeric values.

## Arithmetic Operators

Python supports the following arithmetic operators:

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division (always returns a float)
- `//` : Integer (floor) division
- `%` : Modulus (remainder)
- `**` : Exponentiation (power)

---

## Operator Behavior

- Division (`/`) always produces a floating-point result, even when dividing two integers.
- Integer division (`//`) discards the decimal part and keeps the integer result.
- The modulus operator (`%`) is often used to check divisibility.
- Exponentiation (`**`) is used for power calculations.

## Operator Precedence

Python follows a specific order when evaluating expressions:

1. Parentheses `()`
2. Exponentiation `**`
3. Multiplication, division, floor division, modulus
4. Addition and subtraction

> 📌 Note:  
> When expressions become complex, use parentheses to make calculations clearer and safer.
