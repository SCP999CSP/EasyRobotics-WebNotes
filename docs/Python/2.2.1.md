# 2.2.1 The if Statement

The `if` statement is the most basic form of conditional execution in Python.  
It runs a block of code **only when a condition evaluates to True**.

---

## How the if Statement Works

An `if` statement:
- Evaluates a condition
- Executes the indented code block if the condition is True
- Skips the block if the condition is False

Indentation defines the scope of the conditional block.

## Condition Requirements

- The condition must evaluate to a boolean value
- Comparison and logical expressions are commonly used
- Complex conditions can be built using logical operators

> 📌 Note:  
> Correct indentation is required for `if` statements to work properly.
