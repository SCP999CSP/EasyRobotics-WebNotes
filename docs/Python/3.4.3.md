# 3.4.3 Sets vs Lists

Sets and lists are both used to store collections of data, but they serve **different purposes**.

---

## Key Differences

- Sets store unique elements; lists allow duplicates
- Sets are unordered; lists preserve order
- Sets do not support indexing; lists do
- Sets are optimized for membership tests

---

## When to Use Sets

- When uniqueness is required
- When checking membership frequently
- When performing set operations

---

## When to Use Lists

- When order matters
- When duplicates are allowed
- When indexed access is needed
