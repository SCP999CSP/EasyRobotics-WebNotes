## Union

The union operation:
- Combines elements from multiple sets
- Removes duplicates
- Produces a new set

---

## Intersection

The intersection operation:
- Returns elements common to all sets
- Is useful for finding shared values

---

## Difference

The difference operation:
- Returns elements present in one set but not another
- Helps identify unique elements between groups
