# 4.2.3 Closure Basics

A closure is a function that **remembers variables from its enclosing scope**.  
It allows inner functions to access outer function variables even after the outer function has finished execution.

## How Closures Work

- A function is defined inside another function
- The inner function references variables from the outer function
- The referenced variables are preserved

This behavior enables advanced functional patterns.

## Why Closures Matter

Closures are useful for:
- Data encapsulation
- Maintaining state
- Creating function factories

> 📌 Note:  
> Closures are powerful but should be used thoughtfully to maintain readability.
