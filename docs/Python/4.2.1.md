# 4.2.1 Local and Global Variables

Variables in Python exist within **different scopes**.  
Scope determines where a variable can be accessed and modified.

---

## Local Variables

Local variables:
- Are defined inside a function
- Exist only within that function
- Are created when the function is called

They help isolate data and prevent unintended side effects.

---

## Global Variables

Global variables:
- Are defined outside of functions
- Can be accessed throughout the program
- Should be used sparingly

Modifying global variables inside functions can reduce code clarity.

> 📌 Note:  
> Prefer local variables to avoid unexpected interactions between different parts of a program.
