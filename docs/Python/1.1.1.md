# 1.1.1 Numeric Data Types (int / float / complex)

Python provides several built-in numeric data types to represent numbers.  
The most commonly used ones are **integers**, **floating-point numbers**, and **complex numbers**.

Understanding numeric data types is essential because they directly affect how calculations are performed and how results are stored.

## Integer (`int`)

An integer represents **whole numbers without a decimal point**.

Examples:
- Positive numbers: `1`, `42`
- Negative numbers: `-7`
- Zero: `0`

Integers in Python can be arbitrarily large and are not limited by fixed sizes.

## Floating-Point Number (`float`)

A floating-point number represents **real numbers with a decimal point**.

Examples:
- `3.14`
- `-0.001`
- `2.0`

Floating-point numbers are commonly used in scientific and engineering calculations, but they may introduce **small precision errors** due to how they are stored internally.

---

## Complex Number (`complex`)

A complex number consists of a **real part and an imaginary part**.

Example format:
- `a + bj`

Examples:
- `3 + 4j`
- `1j`

Complex numbers are mainly used in advanced mathematics, physics, and signal processing.

> 📌 Note:  
> In most beginner programs, `int` and `float` are used far more often than `complex`.
