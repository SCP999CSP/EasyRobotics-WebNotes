# 2.2.3 The if-elif-else Chain

The `if-elif-else` chain is used when **multiple conditions must be checked** in sequence.  
It allows a program to select one path from several possible options.

---

## How the Chain Works

- Conditions are evaluated from top to bottom
- The first condition that evaluates to True is executed
- Remaining conditions are skipped
- The optional `else` block handles all remaining cases

---

## Best Practices

- Order conditions from most specific to most general
- Avoid overly complex chains
- Use clear and readable conditions

---

> 📌 Note:  
> Only one block in an `if-elif-else` chain can execute.
