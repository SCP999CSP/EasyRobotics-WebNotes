# 3.4.1 Element Uniqueness in Sets

The defining feature of a set is **uniqueness**.  
Each element in a set appears only once.

---

## Uniqueness Behavior

- Duplicate elements are automatically removed
- The order of elements is not preserved
- Sets only store hashable elements

This behavior makes sets useful for eliminating duplicates.

---

## Common Use Cases

- Removing duplicate values from data
- Tracking unique items
- Performing membership checks

---

> 📌 Note:  
> Sets do not support indexing because they are unordered.
