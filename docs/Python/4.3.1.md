# 4.3.1 Import Methods

Python provides several ways to **import modules and their contents**.  
Choosing the correct import style improves readability and avoids naming conflicts.

## Common Import Forms

Python supports multiple import approaches:
- Importing an entire module
- Importing specific objects from a module
- Importing with an alias

Each approach serves a different purpose depending on usage context.

## Import Behavior

- Imported modules are loaded only once
- Names are added to the current namespace
- Aliases help shorten long module names

> 📌 Note:  
> Prefer explicit imports to keep code clear and maintainable.
