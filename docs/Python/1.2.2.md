# 1.2.2 Multiple Variable Assignment

Python allows assigning values to **multiple variables in a single statement**.  
This feature makes code more concise and expressive.

---

## Assigning Multiple Values

Multiple variables can be assigned at the same time using tuple unpacking.

This is commonly used to:
- Initialize several variables at once
- Swap variable values
- Assign values returned from functions

---

## Value Swapping

Python supports swapping values **without a temporary variable**.

This improves readability and reduces the chance of errors compared to traditional approaches.

---

## Assignment Behavior

When performing multiple assignment:
- The number of variables must match the number of values
- Values are assigned from left to right
- A mismatch raises an error

> 📌 Note:  
> Multiple assignment improves clarity when used appropriately, but avoid overusing it in complex expressions.
