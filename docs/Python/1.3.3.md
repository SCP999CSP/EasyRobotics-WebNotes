# 1.3.3 Formatted Output with f-Strings

Formatted strings, or **f-strings**, provide a clear and readable way to embed variables and expressions inside strings.  
They are the recommended method for string formatting in modern Python.

## What Is an f-String?

An f-string:
- Is prefixed with the letter `f`
- Allows expressions inside `{}` braces
- Is evaluated at runtime

This makes output more expressive and easier to read.

- Better readability
- Supports expressions directly inside strings

## Common Use Cases

- Formatting numerical output
- Creating clear and informative logs
