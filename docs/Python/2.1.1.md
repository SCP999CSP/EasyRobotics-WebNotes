# 2.1.1 Comparison Operators (== != > < >= <=)

Comparison operators are used to **compare two values** and produce a boolean result.

---

## Common Comparison Operators

Python supports the following comparison operators:

- `==` : Equal to
- `!=` : Not equal to
- `>`  : Greater than
- `<`  : Less than
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to
- `<=` : Less than or equal to

Each comparison evaluates to either `True` or `False`.

## Comparison Behavior

- Comparisons can be performed on numbers, strings, and other data types
- The result is always a boolean value
- Comparison results are often used in conditional statements

> 📌 Note:  
> Do not confuse `=` (assignment) with `==` (comparison).
