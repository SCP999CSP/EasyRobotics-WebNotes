Lambda expressions define **small anonymous functions** in a single line.  
They are commonly used for short, simple operations.

## What Is a Lambda Expression?

A lambda expression:
- Has no function name
- Contains a single expression
- Returns the result automatically

It is useful when a full function definition would be unnecessary.

## Common Use Cases

- Simple transformations
- Short-lived helper functions
- Use with functions that expect callable arguments
