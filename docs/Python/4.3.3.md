# 4.3.3 Package Structure and __init__.py

A package is a **directory that groups related modules**.  
Packages help organize large codebases into logical hierarchies.

---

## Package Structure

A typical package:
- Is a directory
- Contains multiple module files
- May include an `__init__.py` file

Packages support hierarchical imports and namespace management.

---

## Role of __init__.py

The `__init__.py` file:
- Marks a directory as a package
- Can initialize package-level code
- Controls what is exposed during imports

> 📌 Note:  
> Well-structured packages improve scalability and code clarity.
