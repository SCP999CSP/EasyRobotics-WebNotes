# 2.3.2 The for Loop

The `for` loop is used to **iterate over a sequence of elements**.  
It is commonly used with lists, ranges, and other iterable objects.

---

## How the for Loop Works

- The loop variable takes each value from the sequence
- The loop body executes once for each element
- The loop ends when all elements are processed

---

## Common Use Cases

- Iterating over lists or strings
- Processing ranges of numbers
- Looping through data collections

---

> 📌 Note:  
> Use `for` loops when the number of iterations is known or based on a sequence.
