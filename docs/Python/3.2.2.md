# 3.2.2 Tuple Unpacking

Tuple unpacking allows **multiple variables to be assigned at once** from a tuple.  
This makes code cleaner and more expressive.

---

## How Tuple Unpacking Works

- Each element in the tuple is assigned to a corresponding variable
- The number of variables must match the number of elements
- Assignment occurs in order

---

## Common Use Cases

- Assigning multiple return values from a function
- Swapping variable values
- Iterating over paired data

> 📌 Note:  
> Tuple unpacking is widely used in Python and improves code readability.
