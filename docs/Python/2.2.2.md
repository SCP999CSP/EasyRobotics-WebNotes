# 2.2.2 The if-else Structure

The `if-else` structure allows a program to choose **between two execution paths**.  
One block runs when the condition is True, and the other runs when it is False.

---

## How if-else Works

- The `if` condition is evaluated first
- If True, the `if` block executes
- Otherwise, the `else` block executes

This ensures that exactly one block is executed.

---

## Common Use Cases

- Handling binary decisions
- Providing default behavior
- Ensuring a fallback action

---

> 📌 Note:  
> Use `else` when there is a clear alternative outcome.
