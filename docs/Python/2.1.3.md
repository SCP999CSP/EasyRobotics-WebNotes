# 2.1.3 Boolean Values and Condition Evaluation

Boolean values represent **truth states** in Python and are central to control flow.

---

## Boolean Values

Python has two boolean values:

- `True`
- `False`

These values are produced by comparisons and logical expressions.

---

## Truth Evaluation

In conditional contexts:
- `True` allows code to execute
- `False` prevents code from executing

Some values are implicitly treated as false, while others are treated as true.

---

## Role in Control Flow

Boolean expressions are used to:
- Control program decisions
- Determine execution paths
- Enable conditional logic

> 📌 Note:  
> Understanding how Python evaluates truth values is essential before learning conditional statements.
