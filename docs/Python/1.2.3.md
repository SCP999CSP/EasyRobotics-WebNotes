Python follows widely accepted community standards.

## snake_case Naming Style

The recommended naming style for variables and functions in Python is **snake_case**.

Characteristics of snake_case:
- All lowercase letters
- Words separated by underscores (`_`)
- Clear and descriptive names

---

## Valid Variable Names

A valid Python variable name:
- Starts with a letter or underscore
- Contains only letters, numbers, and underscores
- Is case-sensitive

---

## Naming Best Practices

- Use meaningful names that describe the variable’s purpose
- Avoid single-letter names except in simple loops
- Do not use Python keywords as variable names
- Prefer clarity over brevity

> Good naming makes code easier to understand, debug, and maintain — especially in larger projects.
