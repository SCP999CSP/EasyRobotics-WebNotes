# 3.2.3 Tuples vs Lists

Tuples and lists are both **ordered collections**, but they serve different purposes.

---

## Key Differences

- Tuples are immutable, lists are mutable
- Tuples are typically used for fixed data
- Lists are used for data that changes over time

---

## When to Use Tuples

- When data should not be modified
- When representing structured records
- When immutability improves safety

---

## When to Use Lists

- When elements need to be added or removed
- When data is processed dynamically
- When flexibility is required

---

> 📌 Note:  
> Choosing between tuples and lists depends on whether data mutability is needed.
