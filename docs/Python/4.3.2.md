Creating custom modules helps organize functionality and reduce duplication.

## Creating a Custom Module

A custom module:
- Is a `.py` file
- Contains functions, variables, or classes
- Can be imported into other files

Modules promote separation of concerns in larger projects.

## Using Custom Modules

- Import it using standard import syntax
- Reuse its functionality across files
