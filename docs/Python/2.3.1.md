# 2.3.1 The while Loop

The `while` loop repeats a block of code **as long as a condition remains True**.  
It is commonly used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

---

## How the while Loop Works

- The condition is evaluated before each iteration
- If the condition is True, the loop body executes
- If the condition becomes False, the loop stops

---

## Common Use Cases

- Repeating actions until a condition is met
- Waiting for a specific state
- Implementing input validation loops

---

> 📌 Note:  
> Always ensure that the loop condition can eventually become False to avoid infinite loops.
