# 2.3.3 Loop Control Statements (break / continue / pass)

Loop control statements change the **normal flow of a loop**.  
They provide fine-grained control over loop execution.

---

## break

The `break` statement:
- Immediately exits the loop
- Skips all remaining iterations

---

## continue

The `continue` statement:
- Skips the current iteration
- Continues with the next iteration

---

## pass

The `pass` statement:
- Does nothing
- Acts as a placeholder where a statement is required syntactically

---

> 📌 Note:  
> Use loop control statements carefully to keep loop logic clear and predictable.
