# 2.1.2 Logical Operators (and / or / not)

Logical operators are used to **combine or modify boolean expressions**.  
They allow more complex conditions to be evaluated.

---

## Logical Operators in Python

Python provides three logical operators:

- `and` : True if both conditions are True
- `or`  : True if at least one condition is True
- `not` : Reverses the boolean value

---

## Logical Evaluation

- Logical expressions are evaluated from left to right
- Python uses short-circuit evaluation
- Logical operators always return a boolean result in conditional contexts

---

## Common Use Cases

- Combining multiple conditions
- Checking ranges and constraints
- Creating readable decision logic

> 📌 Note:  
> Clear logical expressions improve both correctness and readability.
