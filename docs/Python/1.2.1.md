# 1.2.1 Variable Definition and Assignment

In Python, a variable is created **when a value is assigned to a name**.  
No explicit type declaration is required.

## Assigning Values to Variables

The assignment operator `=` is used to assign a value to a variable.

A variable:
- Has a name
- Stores a value
- Refers to an object in memory

Python determines the variable’s data type automatically based on the assigned value.

---

## Reassigning Variables

Variables can be reassigned to new values at any time.

When a variable is reassigned:
- The old value is replaced
- The variable may change its data type
- The variable name remains the same

This behavior is known as **dynamic typing**.

---

## Variable Usage Rules

- A variable must be assigned before it is used
- Variable names are case-sensitive
- Using clear names improves readability

> 📌 Note:  
> Python variables are references to objects, not fixed memory containers.
