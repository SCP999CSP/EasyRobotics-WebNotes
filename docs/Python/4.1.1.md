# 4.1.1 Function Definition (def)

In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword.  
A function definition creates a reusable piece of code that can be called multiple times.

---

## Function Structure

A function definition includes:
- The `def` keyword
- A function name
- Parentheses for parameters
- An indented block of code

The function body contains the statements executed when the function is called.

---

## Function Naming

- Function names should use snake_case
- Names should clearly describe the function’s purpose
- Python keywords must not be used as function names

> 📌 Note:  
> Well-named functions improve code readability and maintainability.
