# 1.1.3 Type Conversion (int() / float() / str())

Type conversion allows you to **change a value from one data type to another**.  
This is useful when working with user input, calculations, and formatted output.

---

## Common Conversion Functions

Python provides built-in functions for type conversion:

- `int()` → converts a value to an integer
- `float()` → converts a value to a floating-point number
- `str()` → converts a value to a string

---

## When Type Conversion Is Needed

Type conversion is commonly required when:
- Reading input from users (input is always a string)
- Combining numbers and text
- Ensuring correct calculation behavior

---

## Conversion Rules and Errors

- Not all strings can be converted into numbers
- Converting a float to an integer removes the decimal part
- Invalid conversions raise errors

Understanding these rules helps prevent unexpected crashes and logic bugs.

> 📌 Note:  
> When a program behaves unexpectedly, checking and converting data types is often the first step in debugging.
