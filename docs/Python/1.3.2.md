# 1.3.2 Getting User Input with input()

The `input()` function is used to **receive input from the user** during program execution.  
It pauses the program and waits for the user to type a value.

---

## How input() Works

When `input()` is called:
- The program displays an optional prompt
- The user enters text
- The input is returned as a string

This behavior is consistent regardless of what the user types.

---

## Input and Data Types

Because `input()` always returns a string:
- Numeric input must be converted before calculations
- Type conversion is often required

Understanding this behavior is critical for avoiding logic errors.

---

## Common Use Cases

- Asking for user information
- Reading configuration values
- Interactive scripts and tools

> 📌 Note:  
> Always consider type conversion when working with user input.
