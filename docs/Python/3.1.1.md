# 3.1.1 List Definition and Access

A list is defined using **square brackets** and elements are separated by commas.  
Each element in a list has a position called an index.

## Defining a List

Lists can contain:
- Numbers
- Strings
- Other lists
- Mixed data types

Lists preserve the order in which elements are added.

---

## Accessing List Elements

- List elements are accessed using their index
- Indexing starts at zero
- Negative indices access elements from the end

Accessing elements correctly is essential for data processing and iteration.

> 📌 Note:  
> Accessing an index outside the list range causes an error.
